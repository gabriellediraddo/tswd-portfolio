# Critique By Design

Six hours of scrolling through smart, informative, clear data visualizations later, I came across the following graphic [in an article](https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change-emissions-data-charts-cop26/a-59652069) about climate change and what questions and answers world leaders might want to know when discussing its global impact. This graphic was nestled under the question: "What are the major sources of greenhouse gas emmissions?" and considers which countries have been the world's biggest drivers of deforestation.
