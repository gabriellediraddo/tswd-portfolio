# Visualizing Government Debt

Beginning with OECD's General Government Debt tool

Presenting the data with line bars in a series allows for easier comparison and makes trends across time more visible. I added a title and subtitle to clarify the purpose of the chart, but because a trend did not emerge across all countries represented, the subtitle reads quite vague. I made minor adjustments to spacing in order to create some more white space, as too many charts made it look noisy. To this end, I also decreased the number of charts per line from 5 to 4 in the default settings.
