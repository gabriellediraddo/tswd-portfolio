Here's where all my cool work will go.

# About me
Hello! I'm Gabrielle. I'm in the final semester of my Arts Management master's program. I am looking forward to moving to New York when I graduate and working in the arts. 

# What I hope to learn
As a future arts manager, I hope to move arts organizations away from "survival" and "scarcity" mindsets by embracing flexibility, change, and centering community through data-driven decision making. In this class, I want to learn how to communicate data effectively with a variety of stakeholders and decision makers. I am eager to use this opportunity to learn how to use Tableau and other, more cost-effective data visualization methods. I also want to be able to quickly understand data visualizations and identify key questions or gaps in information, so that when I am a manager and am presented with data visualizations, I can make informed decisions.
