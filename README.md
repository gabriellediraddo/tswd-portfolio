Here's where all my cool work will go.

# About me
Hello! I'm Gabrielle. I'm in the final semester of my Arts Management master's program. I am looking forward to moving to New York when I graduate and working in the arts. 

# What I hope to learn
talk about what you're interested in getting out of the course and what you are planning to do once you graduate.  You can include other information you think is helpful to the rest of the class

As a future arts manager, I hope to move arts organizations away from "survival" and "scarcity" mindsets by embracing flexibility, change, and centering community through data-driven decision making. In this class, I want to learn how to communicate data effectively with a variety of stakeholders and decision makers. I am eager to use this opportunity to learn how to use Tableau and other, more cost-effective data visualization methods. I also want to be able to quickly understand data visualizations and identify key questions or gaps in information, so that when I am a manager and am presented with data visualizations, I can make informed decisions.
